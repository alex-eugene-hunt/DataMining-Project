To run this program make sure that you have the following libraries installed on your machine hosting Python 3:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TKinter
- MatPlotLib
- Dill
- Pickle

To run this program:
- Save our files into a folder and open in VS Code
- The project directory structure should be the same as seen in our GitHub
- If all the .pkl files are in the /algorithms folder, Simply run the GUI.py script to fully use all the implementations
- If not, execute each algorithm python file and wait for the .pkl file to be save in the /algorithms folder
- Now, execute the GUI.py python script 

The algorithms to make each model are found in the /algorithms folder.
The models for each algorithm are saved as .pkl files and are seen in the /algorihms folder of the project.
To save a new model for each algorithm, simple execute the algorithm python file.

The dataset folder hosts the accessed dataset. 'meteorites.csv' is an exact replica of 'Meteorite_Landings_20240909.csv'. The later is the default name.

App_Icon.ico is the image associated with the GUI.

GUI.py is the main file that incorperates everything in the project.
